### Overview:
The provided Python code leverages the `openpyxl` library to manipulate Excel workbooks programmatically. It demonstrates a series of operations aimed at processing data, calculating averages, determining pass/fail statuses, counting occurrences, styling, calculating increases, and plotting charts.

### Loading and Manipulating Excel Data:
The code begins by loading an Excel workbook specified by the `filename1` parameter using the `load_workbook()` function from the `openpyxl` library. It then accesses the active worksheet (`ws`) within the workbook to perform various operations.

### Calculating Averages:
One of the primary tasks of the code is to calculate the average of each module. It achieves this by iterating through the columns representing each module's scores, summing up the scores for each student, and dividing by the total number of students. The calculated averages are then written to the worksheet along with appropriate labels.

### Determining Pass/Fail Status:
Following the calculation of averages, the code proceeds to determine whether each student has passed or failed based on a passing threshold of 50%. It calculates each student's average score as a percentage and writes the pass/fail status accordingly to the worksheet.

### Counting Pass/Fail Occurrences:
To provide further insights, the code counts the occurrences of "PASS" and "FAIL" statuses among the students. It utilizes the `COUNTIF` function to tally the number of students who have passed and failed, writing the totals in the worksheet.

### Styling:
To enhance readability and visualization, the code applies various styles to the worksheet. It bolds and colors the headings and labels to distinguish them from the data, making it easier to interpret the information presented.

### Calculating Increase in Bursary Funds:
Another aspect of the code's functionality involves calculating a 10% increase in bursary funds for each student. It achieves this by adjusting the existing values accordingly and writing the corrected amounts to the worksheet.

### Plotting Charts:
To provide visual representations of the processed data, the code plots two types of charts. A bar graph illustrates module percentages, depicting the average scores for each module. Additionally, a pie chart showcases the pass rate among the students, visually representing the distribution of pass and fail statuses.

### Saving Changes:
Finally, after completing all data processing and visualization tasks, the modified workbook is saved with the prefix "new" appended to the original filename. This ensures that the changes made by the code are preserved for future reference or analysis.

In essence, this Python code demonstrates the power and versatility of using programming to automate data processing tasks in Excel, enabling efficient analysis and visualization of large datasets.
